# Extraneous Files Archive

This directory contains files that are not currently necessary for the main project but are kept for reference.

Moving files here keeps the main codebase clean without permanently deleting these items. The archive includes backup scripts, environment-specific helpers, and other utilities. A list of archived scripts is maintained in `ARCHIVE.md`.

**Team note:** If you encounter an extra or outdated file while working on the project, move it here instead of deleting it. Other agents can review this folder later for additional context or content that may prove useful.
