# Stub Backlog

This backlog tracks all modules currently marked with `AGENT_STUB` comments. Each entry records the
file path, a short description of its intended functionality, the date it was flagged, and the
current status or plan for implementation. Update this list whenever a stub is added or removed.

| File Path | Description | Date Flagged | Status/Plan |
