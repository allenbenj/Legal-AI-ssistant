# Legacy Extras

This folder stores legacy scripts and reference utilities preserved during cleanup. These files are not imported by the current codebase but may contain useful patterns or data for future reference.

All contents were moved from their original locations on cleanup. They should not be executed automatically. Review carefully before use.

The folder now also contains older helper scripts previously stored under `legal_ai_system/scripts` such as `minimal_api.py` and setup utilities. Only `main.py` and `streamlit_app.py` remain as active entry points.

Additional utility modules were later relocated here from `legal_ai_system/utils` to simplify the active package. Examples include `document_router.py`, `ontology_integration.py`, and other experimental helpers.
