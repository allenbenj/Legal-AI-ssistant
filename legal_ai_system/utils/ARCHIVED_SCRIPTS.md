# Archived Utility Scripts

This folder originally contained several experimental document parsing modules. The following files were removed in favor of the cleaned `criminal_law_parser.py` implementation:

- **Criminal_Law_Parser_0.py** – Early asynchronous parser using SpaCy, Neo4j, and deduplication via fuzzy matching.
- **Document_Parser.py** – Synchronous variant of the document parser with similar functionality.

These scripts were superseded by more maintainable utilities and are kept here for historical reference.
