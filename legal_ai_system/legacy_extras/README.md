# Legacy Extras Folder

This directory contains scripts and modules that were archived from the active codebase. They remain for historical reference but are not used by the main application. Moving these files here simplifies maintenance while keeping the original work accessible.

This folder also houses older utility modules and helper scripts that were phased out during refactoring. They remain for reference but are not loaded by the application.
